        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I’m an aspiring web designer with a passion for art and design. I have worked in a variety of creative jobs over the years and am hopeful that the skills I have accrued may be transferable to the process of building fantastic looking websites.</p>
        <p>I’ve always loved working with my hands and creating things. In my free time I make kitchen knives. </p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>I am serious about becoming a web developer and working in tech. I can't wait to improve my skills and start applying for jobs once I am a competent developer. I want to master the process of building web sites and increase my knowledge, skills and abilities in:</p>
        <ul class="skills">

          <li>JS</li>
          <li>PHP</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Initially I’d like to work for a web design firm in order to improve my skills and become an excellent developer. After gaining some years experience in the industry I would also be interested in working remotely as a freelancer in order to travel or live abroad. </p>
