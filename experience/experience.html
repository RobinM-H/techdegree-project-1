                    After finishing comprehensive school, I went on to study a variety of different subjects which have included:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>reed organ restoration</li>
                  <li>art &amp; design</li>
                  <li>music technology</li>
                  <li>technical theatre lighting</li>
                  <li>agriculture</li>
                </ul>
                <p>I eventually did a degree in violin making and restoration at <a href="https://www.lincolncollege.ac.uk/courses/ba-hons-musical-instrument-craft-violin-making-and-repair/" target="_blank">Lincoln College</a> in Newark on Trent. The school is renowned worldwide for it's excellent standards.</p>

            <img src="../images/bar.jpg" alt="bar man" class="round-borders" style="width:100%">
            <p>From the age of 15 I have worked in the hospitality industry as a barman, waiter and hotel attendant. It kept me going while I persued my creative interests and supported me throughout my studies over the course of my degree. After finishing my degree I worked for a number of violin restoration shops and eventually started my own restoration business <a href="https://www.voxhumane.co.uk/" target="_blank">Vox Humane.</a> I built the website for my business using <a href="https://www.squarespace.com" target="_blank">Squarespace</a> which is how I first developed an interest in web development.</p>
